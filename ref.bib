abstract = {Drilling well control is complex and dynamic with high uncertainty because of the complicated geological conditions and operational environments. Until now, quantitative risk assessment on drilling well control is not integrating human errors, equipment failure, and internal mechanisms together. To address the research gap, this paper presents a novel dynamic quantitative risk assessment method for drilling well control by integrating multi types of risk factors. The entire dynamic Bayesian network is composed of models of human factors, mechanical factors, and environmental factors. The presented method is demonstrated by a case of well section. The dynamic characteristics of the overall risk and individual risks caused by different types of factors are obtained. The influences of human, mechanical and environmental factors on drilling well control risk are researched. It shows that environmental factors have the highest influence on the whole drilling well control risk in Breccia formation. The parameters uncertainty analysis on collapse pressure and fracture pressure of three different rock formations are carried out. It is found out that in-situ stresses have the highest influence on the collapse and fracture pressure.}
